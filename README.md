# Loan Approval Classification

This project analyzes a loan approval dataset to evaluate whether approved and non-approved applicants can be distinguished using key financial features such as income, debt-to-income ratio, and credit score.

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) was conducted using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib. Kernel Density Estimate (KDE) visualizations were used to compare feature distributions across approval outcomes. The analysis shows that while certain trends exist—such as higher approval likelihood at lower debt-to-income ratios and higher credit scores—no single feature clearly separates approval decisions on its own.

These findings highlight the importance of evaluating features collectively when preparing data for binary classification models.
